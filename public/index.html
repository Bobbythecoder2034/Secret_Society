        Welcome, seeker—though you may not yet know what you have stumbled into, the truth will soon surround you. A door has been opened, and from it steps a force that threatens the very balance of our world. We cannot rely on chance or blind courage; only those with sharp minds, unshaken resolve, and the will to confront the unknown may stand against what comes. These trials are no mere games—they are a measure of your ability to endure the shadows ahead. Should you succeed, the path to our hidden order will reveal itself. Should you fail… the darkness will claim another.

        Due to the society's youth, we have yet to hire an adequate website developer, so each puzzle is on a different page. You must type out your answers in the URL. They must follow the format of "localhost:5000/" followed by your answer. The letters must all be lowercase and all spaces will be substituted for _ underscores. If you need a hint, press the lightbulb to get a hint for the puzzle.
